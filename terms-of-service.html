        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: August 8, 2025</p>
        
        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By downloading, installing, or using the Tamagrey mobile application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>Tamagrey is a digital wellbeing iOS application that combines screen time management with a virtual pet experience. The App uses Apple's Screen Time API to help users manage their device usage while maintaining a virtual pet whose health depends on focus activity.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Screen Time Permissions</h2>
        <p>The App requires Screen Time permissions to function properly. By granting these permissions, you authorize the App to monitor and restrict access to selected applications on your device during focus sessions. This data is processed locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</p>
        
        <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You are responsible for:</p>

        <h2>6. Subscription Service</h2>
        <p>Tamagrey operates as a subscription-based service. Access to the App's core features requires an active subscription.</p>
        <p>• Subscription fees are charged through your Apple ID account<br>
        • Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period<br>
        • You can manage and cancel subscriptions through your Apple ID account settings<br>
        • Subscription fees are non-refundable except as required by applicable law</p>
        
        <h2>7. Payments and Refunds</h2>
        <p>All payments are processed through Apple's App Store. Our refund policy follows Apple's standard refund policy:</p>
        <p>• All sales are final and non-refundable except as required by law<br>
        • Refund requests must be made through Apple, not directly to us<br>
        • Unused portions of subscription periods are not refundable<br>
        • Access to premium features ends immediately upon cancellation or refund</p>
        
        <h2>8. Privacy and Data</h2>

        <h2>9. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>The App is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or meet your specific requirements. The virtual pet feature is for entertainment purposes only.</p>
        
        <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages resulting from your use of the App.</p>
        
        <h2>11. Updates to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify users of significant changes through the App or other appropriate means. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
        
        <h2>12. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the App at any time, with or without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users or our business. Upon termination:</p>
        <p>• Your subscription will remain active until its expiration date<br>
        • No refunds will be provided for remaining subscription time<br>
        • You will lose access to all premium features immediately upon account termination</p>
